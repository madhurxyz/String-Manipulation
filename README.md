#String Manipulation
I wrote functions that manipulate strings and arrays.
This is the first step of an NLP Tweet Generator project I'm working on.

##Functions
1. Shuffle - imported from built-in random function to shuffle an array of strings
2. Rearrange - self-written function that rearranges an array of strings
3. Reverse1 - a function to reverse a string utilizing slicing
4. Reverse2 - self-written function to reverse a string by iterating through the string's character elements
5. Madlibs - a function that creates a small madlibs game
6. Anagram - a function that rearranges letters randomly to generate an anagram of a given string
